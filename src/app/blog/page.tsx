        Grounded Factuality: What LLM-AggreFact performance means
        </h2>
        <div className="space-y-6">
          <p className="leading-normal">
            &quot;Hallucination&quot; is used to refer to many types of errors
            in LLM responses. Here we are interested in grounded factuality: Assuming 
            that we are given a context paragraph and a statement, we want to check if 
            that statement is logically supported by the context (aka grounding documents). 
            One key type of error is when a model fails to accurately reflect information 
            given in its context and produces an answer with hallucinations. The MiniCheck 
            paper calls this <em>fact-checking on grounding documents</em>.

            with the format: (<i>{"{"}</i><i>D</i><i>{"}"}</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>y</i>), 
            where <i>{"{"}</i><i>D</i><i>{"}"}</i> is a grounding document set, <i>c</i> is a
            claim, and <i>y</i> is a boolean label to indicate whether <i>c</i>{" "}

            There are two general approaches to this task. First, LLMs can be
            prompted zero-shot with the document(s) and the claim, and asked if
            the claim is supported by the document(s). Second, models designed
            for related subtasks like textual entailment or question answering

            Cost Considerations
          </h2>
          <p className="leading-normal">
            We think it&apos;s important for LLM fact-checkers to be small and
            cheap to run. A response from an LLM might consist of many
            sentences. To identify and localize errors, a fact-checker needs to
            be called many times. If we use GPT-4 as the fact-checker, we can
            easily spend {">"}10x more to verify the response than we did to
            produce it in the first place!
          </p>
          <p className="leading-normal">
            The leaderboard also includes model size as a key factor. For most
            models, this correlates with FLOPs and cost in a standard way.
            However, this is a stark divide between open-source models and
            closed-source models. Fact-checking the examples in the benchmark
            can cost as much as $100 when using GPT-4, but as little as $1 when
            using smaller models hosted on premise. We hope to provide guidance
            to practitioners about what models perform well across different
            scales.
